# Geospatial AI for Public Health — Dengue/Flood Risk Mapping (Bangladesh)

Turning free satellite imagery into a ward-level dengue and flood risk map for
Bangladesh: an AI model (U-Net / EO foundation models) segments water, built-up area,
and flooding from Sentinel-1/2, the result is vectorized and joined with real DGHS
dengue case data, and a spatial model turns that into a risk score a health department
can act on.

This is a phased learning-and-build project, not a single script — see
[`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the full roadmap (13 phases, H0 through H13), the model/skill
coverage matrix, data sources, and the ethics rules every phase follows.

## Why this exists

Bangladesh has severe annual dengue outbreaks and monsoon flooding. Satellite imagery
(free, public, updated every few days) can show standing water, built-up density, and
land-surface temperature at ward level — real predictors of disease risk — but turning
pixels into a decision-ready map takes the same model-selection skill demonstrated in
[`best-model-for-satellite-imagery`](https://github.com/khalilurrrahmanridoykhan/best-model-for-satellite-imagery)
(segmentation vs. detection), now pointed at a real public-health question instead of a
benchmark dataset.

## Current status

**Phase H1 done** — `src/imagery.get_imagery(aoi, date_range, sensor)`: a reusable,
cloud-masked composite from Microsoft Planetary Computer, verified against both a dry
and a monsoon season over Dhaka. The monsoon run surfaced a real finding (not assumed):
persistent cloud cover left ~65% of pixels without a single clear observation even
after compositing multiple scenes — confirming why the plan calls for a Sentinel-1 SAR
path (Phase H5) rather than relying on optical imagery alone. See
[`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md) for the numbers and [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) section 6 for
what's next (H2 — Random Forest land-cover baseline).

## Repo layout

```
PLAN.md           # the full phased roadmap -- start here
data/
├── raw/          # downloaded satellite scenes + boundary files (gitignored)
└── processed/    # derived rasters/vectors (gitignored, reproducible from notebooks/)
notebooks/        # one notebook per phase, in order
src/              # shared, unit-tested code the notebooks import
tests/            # pytest tests, using synthetic/small data (no download needed)
scripts/          # data-fetching and pipeline scripts
```

## Running it

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

pytest tests/ -v
```

Notebooks pull real Sentinel-1/2 imagery from the Microsoft Planetary Computer STAC
catalog — free, no account or API key needed for search or download.

## Rules this project follows

One branch → one PR (`Phase X — <name>`) → merge → tag `phase-x`. `main` always runs
end-to-end on at least a small sample AOI. Free tiers only (Planetary Computer / Google
Earth Engine for data, Colab/Kaggle for GPU training). Spatial (block) cross-validation
always, never a plain random split. See [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) section 3 and 10 for the
full rules and the ethics guardrails around any settlement/poverty-adjacent output.
